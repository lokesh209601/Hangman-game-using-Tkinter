The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing puzzle where the player attempts to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. 
Traditionally played with paper and pen, this digital version recreates the same experience through a simple and interactive graphical interface.
This project is developed using Python as the primary programming language and Tkinter for building the graphical user interface (GUI). 
Tkinter provides buttons, text boxes, and labels to make the game interactive and visually appealing. 
The system randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player must guess the letters correctly before running out of attempts. 
With each wrong guess, a part of the hangman figure appears, providing a visual cue of progress and mistakes.
The project highlights the use of event-driven programming and GUI design in Python. It also demonstrates the integration of modules, randomization, and basic file handling. 
The game provides immediate feedback to the user through messages and visuals, making it both educational and entertaining.
This project serves as a beginner-friendly example of how Python can be used to design engaging desktop applications that combine logic, interactivity, and creativity. 
In addition, it helps students understand fundamental programming principles while creating an enjoyable gaming experience.
